# Ex02b Normalization Process
## Vishwas Rao and Darshana Patel

## Step 1 Identify all the candidate keys of the relation
PetAndOwner (PetName, PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB, OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone, OwnerEmail)

## Identify all the functional dependencies in the relation.
PetName (PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB, OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone, OwnerEmail)

OwnerPhone (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerEmail)

OwnerEmail (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone)

PetAndOwner candidate key is PetName

OwnerPhone and OwnerEmail are not candidate keys for PetAndOwner

## Step 2
### Further seperate into:
OWNER (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone, OwnerEmail)

PET (PetName, PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB)

## Step 3: Functional Dependencies
### *PET* 
PetName (PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB)

PET Candidate Key is PetName

PET (*PetName*, PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB)

### *OWNER* 
OwnerEmail (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone)

OwnerPhone (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerEmail)

Candidate keys here are OwnerEmail and OwnerPhone.

If we choose OwnerPhone:

OWNER (*OwnerPhone*, OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerEmail)

## Normalized Relations
OWNER (*OwnerPhone*, OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerEmail)

PET (*PetName*, PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB, OwnerPhone)
