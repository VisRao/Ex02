# Ex02b Normalization Process
## Vishwas Rao and Darshana Patel

## Step 1 Identify all the candidate keys of the relation
PetAndOwner (PetName, PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB, OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone, OwnerEmail)

## Step 2 Identify all the functional dependencies in the relation.
PetName (PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB, OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone, OwnerEmail)

OwnerPhone (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerEmail)

OwnerEmail (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone)

PetAndOwner candidate key is PetName

OwnerPhone and OwnerEmail are not candidate keys for PetAndOwner

## 
### Further seperate into:
OWNER (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone, OwnerEmail)

PET (PetName, PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB)

## Step 3: Examine the determinants of the functional dependencies
## a. Place the columns of the functional dependency in a new relation of their own. 
   b. Make the determinant of the functional dependency the primary key of the new relation.
   c. Leave a copy of the determinant as a foreign key in the original relation. 
   d. Create a referential integrity constraint between the original and the new relation. 
### *PET* 
PetName (PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB)

PET Candidate Key is PetName

PET (*PetName*, PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB)

### *OWNER* 
OwnerEmail (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerPhone)

OwnerPhone (OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerEmail)

Candidate keys here are OwnerEmail and OwnerPhone.

If we choose OwnerPhone:

OWNER (*OwnerPhone*, OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerEmail)

## Normalized Relations
OWNER (*OwnerPhone*, OwnerLastName, OwnerFirstName, OwnerEmail)

PET (*PetName*, PetType, PetBreed, PetDOB, OwnerPhone)
4. Repeat Step 3 until every determinant of every relation is a candidate key
